## Hello! Welcome to my github profile! 
## About Me  
I am a **recent Computer Science graduate from Cardiff University (BSc Hons, 2025)**, currently seeking **graduate opportunities in software engineering, AI, and emerging technologies**.  

Throughout my degree, I focused not only on developing strong programming skills but also on applying them in projects that balance **technical complexity with real-world application**. My work demonstrates both the ability to write efficient, maintainable code and the willingness to explore challenging, innovative areas such as **machine learning and autonomous systems**.  

I am highly motivated, always eager to learn new technologies quickly, and I thrive in environments where I can combine **problem-solving, teamwork, and creativity** to deliver results.

## Key Projects  

### SteeringNet (Dissertation Project)  
Developed an **evolutionary artificial neural network** (EANN) from scratch in Unity (C#) to explore **deep learning–based obstacle avoidance** for self-driving vehicles.  
- Built a custom simulation environment  
- Implemented genetic algorithms to evolve driving behaviour through trial and error  
- Discussed technical, ethical, and societal implications of autonomous driving in detail

### Flask website - Shake Haven
This project is a Flask-based web application built using, python, html, css and jinja and is showcasing a milkshake and boba tea store.
It demonstrates use of Flask, SQLAlchemy, session management and string validation.
The application supports product listings, user login, shopping cart functionality, and a basic checkout flow.

### Chess Project  
Designed a **Python chess engine** with a board simulation. This project strengthened my skills in **algorithm design, problem-solving, and object-oriented programming**.  

### Aurelia Beauty and Batham Construction (Work in Progress projects for friends)  
A **Flask + SQL web platform** for financial/business services, built collaboratively. Includes database integration, user profiles, and a focus on clean, modular design.  

### Multiplayer Unity Game  
Created a **multiplayer game in Unity (C#)** as part of a group project. This required collaboration, communication, and agile planning, while also developing technical skills in **game logic, networking, and software design**.  

### Accounting and financial services website 
Currently developing a **full-stack accounting and financial services web application** using Flask, SQL, and Docker, with deployment planned on Azure. The project demonstrates database integration, user authentication, and clean modular design while showcasing skills in cloud deployment and modern software practices.
